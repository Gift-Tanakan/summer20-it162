<h3>Great practices of building shopping carts.</h3>


<p>Building an online shopping cart has so many things to consider, especially when many businesses go online. Ineffective or insecure shopping carts can be left behind in the competition and lose opportunities to thrive really easily. According to Michael Harbone, digital marketing copywriter, ‘For many industries, shopping cart abandonment rates can weigh in between 60 to 80 percent. While the shopping cart itself isn’t always to blame, a poor cart can certainly increase abandonment rates.’ (Harbone) This can give some proof why user experience about shopping carts is crucial. Therefore, let’s explore some practices in building a good online shopping cart for a business.</p>

<p><strong>Security comes first.</strong> It’s a smart move to work with a third party business that offers world-class secured payment processing and transaction encryption such as PayPal. It helps you avoid any money trouble or users’ stolen information that may arise later if you try to set up the payment process on your own. Security issues are the last thing you want to deal with because it will affect your business severely; users lose trust, have bad experience, give awful reviews, etc. Regarding PCI Security Standards Council, ‘29% of consumers surveyed said they would never again use a small business that suffered a data breach.’</p> 

<p><strong>Simple design and clear navigation.</strong> Simplicity is key. Your shopping cart should be easy to view all the products with necessary details, easy to put in credit card details, billing address and shipping address, and easy to navigate around or modify data. 
</p>

<p><strong>Include products’ images!</strong> Having products’ images displayed clearly along with the titles reduces users’ confusion and frustration, especially when they purchase the same kind of products but different variations. Images also help users browse and modify with ease. Above all, like a visual, clear confirmation, they can help users buy faster.</p>

<p><strong>Allow several payment methods.</strong> Some people pay with a credit card directly, some always use PayPal, some use other methods. Payment should be the most convenient process of the whole shopping cart flow. No users will feel satisfied once they’re willing to pay for your product, but your payment methods are too limited. Therefore, the more alternatives you can provide for users, the less sales you lose.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile friendly.</strong> Unquestionably, your shopping cart interface has to fully support mobile devices as effectively as desktop.</p>

<p>Building a shopping cart is a thoughtful process and it tremendously affects your bottom line, which is sales. Therefore, you need to make it as efficient as possible by considering the practices mentioned above. Then you’ll have a solid fundamentals and confidence to promote your products and earn nice users’ reviews.</p>

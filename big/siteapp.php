<h3>A glimpse of what to create between a responsive website and a mobile application.</h3>


<p>There is no doubt that building a mobile-supported platform is a must for a business in this era. However, when it comes to choosing whether to develop a responsive website for mobile or a mobile application, it can be tricky to pick one. This article will guide you through some key differences of each option.</p>

<p>According to Tania H., <em>‘A mobile website is superior to a mobile application in matters of compatibility, accessibility, and maintenance, it is a great first step to boost and support your mobile marketing campaign.’</em>(H.) That is a nice summary about why a responsive website is a good choice. Here is an opinion from Viktor Korol about why a mobile application should also be a great choice: <em>‘Mobile apps work differently than responsive websites. They don’t run on all devices and need to be installed separately but what they give is unique user experience. While your website is aimed at attracting new or occasional clients your mobile app works with regular clients.’</em>(Korol) Let’s break this down.</p> 

<p><strong>Cost</strong>: A responsive site is cheaper to build because it basically needs hosting and domain payments and can be used with all devices. For a mobile application, developer license is required for getting on the application marketplace. Besides, if aimed to serve mobile users in various operating systems, it needs to be built with different languages, which causes even more investment.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: A responsive site can be accessed across all devices through a browser window. It doesn’t need to be set up in the user’s mobile. A mobile application, on the other hand, needs to be installed from an application platform like App Store before a user can use it. That means the application will take up some space in the user’s device as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: A responsive website is easier to fix bug and maintenance but the mobile application is harder to do so especially once it’s downloaded into the device. Users may need to wait for the next version or need to update the application themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Personalization</strong>: A responsive website doesn’t have many personalization functions when compared to an application. An application can offer so many ways for users to customize such as, setting push notification, that makes an application create a more unique experience for users than a responsive website can do.
</p>

<p>Therefore, deciding to build one thing and not the other really depends on our resources and investment we’re willing to make, also the purpose of the business. If our investments are unlimited and we aim to develop great, customizable user experience, why not do both? </p>
